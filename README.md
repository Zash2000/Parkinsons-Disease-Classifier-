# Parkinson's Disease Classifier
This notebook demonstrates classification of Parkinson’s disease using speech data features.
A machine learning project to classify Parkinson’s Disease using voice recordings and biomedical voice measurements. Built using Python, scikit-learn, and various data science libraries.

## 📌 Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to identify Parkinson’s Disease from a dataset of biomedical voice measurements. It explores key stages of a typical ML pipeline: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, evaluation, and comparison.
